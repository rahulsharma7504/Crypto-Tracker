# Crypto Tracker

A simple crypto tracker built with a React frontend and an Express + MongoDB backend. The app fetches live coin data from CoinGecko, stores current and historical snapshots in MongoDB, and exposes APIs for the frontend to render the dashboard and coin history. A cron job periodically saves history data.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), React Router, Ant Design, Axios, Recharts, dayjs
- Backend: Node.js (Express), Mongoose (MongoDB), Axios (server-side to CoinGecko), jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs
- Data store: MongoDB Atlas (or any MongoDB instance)
- Cron: node-cron

- Frontend (deployed): https://your-frontend-url.example.com  <!-- replace with actual URL -->
- Backend (deployed): https://your-backend-url.example.com   <!-- replace with actual URL -->

Replace the above URLs with your actual deployed URLs.

## Requirements

- Node 18+ recommended
- npm (or yarn)
- A MongoDB instance (MongoDB Atlas recommended)

---

## Repository structure

- client/ - React frontend (Vite + Ant Design)
- server/ - Express backend, routes, controllers, models, cron job

---

## Environment variables

Server (in `server/.env`):

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
JWT_SECRET=<jwt-secret>
ADMIN_EMAIL=<admin-email>
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin-password>
```

Client: use Vite environment variable to point to backend (create `client/.env` or set in hosting):

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.example.com
```

Notes:
- Do not commit `.env` files. Keep secrets (JWT secret, DB credentials) safe.
- If you host frontend over HTTPS, make sure `VITE_API_URL` uses `https://` to avoid mixed-content blocking.

## Setup & installation (local)

1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone <repo-url>
cd crypto-tracker
```

2. Server setup

```powershell
cd server
npm install
# create .env and set MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm run dev   # starts with nodemon: server.js
```

3. Client setup

```powershell
cd ../client
npm install
# optional: create client/.env with VITE_API_URL set to your backend
npm run dev
```

Open the client dev server (Vite) in your browser (usually http://localhost:5173). Log in using the ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD values from the server `.env`.

## How the cron job works

- The server includes a scheduled job (using `node-cron`) that periodically fetches the top coins from CoinGecko and saves their current state into two places:
  - `CurrentData` collection: upserts latest snapshot for each coin.
  - `HistoryData` collection: inserts a record for historical tracking.

- The cron schedule is started from `server/server.js` (or via `utils/cronJob.js`). On server start the cron job is activated; it will run at the configured interval (see `utils/cronJob.js`).

Usage and notes:
- You can trigger history collection manually by calling the backend route `POST /api/coins/history` if you want an on-demand snapshot.
- Make sure the server can reach CoinGecko (no firewall or networking restrictions).

## API overview

- `POST /api/auth/login` — Login with `{ email, password }` (admin credentials from `.env`) -> returns `{ token }` JWT
- `GET /api/coins` — Returns the current top coins data (used by the dashboard)
- `POST /api/coins/history` — (optional/manual) fetch current coins and save history records
- `GET /api/coins/history/:coinId` — Returns historical records for a given coin ID

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api` in the server (e.g., `https://your-backend.example.com/api/coins`).

---

## Deployment notes

- Backend: host on a Node-capable host (Heroku, Render, Railway, DigitalOcean App Platform, etc.). Ensure `MONGO_URI` and other env vars are configured in the host.
- Frontend: host on static hosts (Vercel, Netlify, Surge). Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in the hosting dashboard to point to your backend.

Example Vercel / Netlify environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL` -> https://your-backend.example.com

---

## Security & recommendations

- For production, consider issuing httpOnly secure cookies for authentication instead of storing JWTs in localStorage.
- Rotate JWT_SECRET for security and store secrets in the host's environment settings.
- Use HTTPS in production.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Mixed Content errors: If your frontend is HTTPS and backend is HTTP, requests will be blocked. Use HTTPS backend or update `VITE_API_URL`.
- CORS errors: Server uses CORS, but confirm hosting platform does not override. Check server console logs.
- No history data: Ensure the cron job is running or call `POST /api/coins/history` once to populate `HistoryData`.
